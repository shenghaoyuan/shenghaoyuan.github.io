I am always interested in working with self-motivated students on challening research problems. Before reaching out to me, kindly take the time to read this post.  I will provide some general advice applicable to all students, followed by specific advice for specific classes of students.

<h3>To all students</h3>
When contacting me, please kindly provide a CV that outlines your educational achievements, any previous research experience you may have had, references to any code you have authored, and a list of software programs with which you are familiar with.

<br>
Including just a CV in the email may not be enough. 
Please take the opportunity to review my <a href="https://rainoftime.github.io/">publications</a> and the suggested reading list <a href="https://rainoftime.github.io/html/reading.html">here</a>. Additionally, include a detailed explanation of how your interests and background align with my research endeavors.
You can also try building and running the open-source tools developed by my group that are available on <a href="https://github.com/ZJU-Automated-Reasoning-Group">GitHub</a>.

<h3>To prospective Master/Ph.D. students</h3>


<h3>To undergraduate students</h3>

For undergraduate students (SRTP, final year project, research assistant, etc), you are welcome to explore various potential research directions:
      <ul>
         <li class="item">
          <a>Automated software development techniques for enhancing developer productivity and software quality such as performance, security, and robustness.</a>
        </li>
         <li class="item">
          <a>Applying PL/SE/FM/Sec techniques to more domains of computation such as crypto, system software, and computations on emerging hardware platforms.</a>
        </li>
        <li class="item">
        <a>Theorem proving/constraint solving for various logical theories (with or without applicaitons in PL/SE/FM/Sec).</a>
        </li>
         <li class="item">
          <a>Other ideas the students come up with.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
